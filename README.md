# SDSU_Interactive_Map
This project involved designing and implementing an interactive SDSU campus map using p5.js without any mapping libraries. It features navigation (zoom/pan), building and parking info, and an overview map showing the current extent, allowing users to explore the campus digitally with smooth performance across zoom levels.
